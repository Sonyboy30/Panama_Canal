      <h2>Construction & Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The American effort to build the Panama Canal began in 1904, led by Chief Engineers John Stevens and later George Washington Goethals. Unlike the failed French attempt, the Americans adopted a lock-based system to manage elevation and flooding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tropical diseases like malaria and yellow fever initially devastated the workforce until Dr. William Gorgas implemented sanitation campaigns, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds. Workers endured dangerous conditions, frequent landslides, and grueling heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1913, over 200 million cubic yards of earth had been removed, and the locks and dams stood as marvels of modern engineering.
