    <h2>Before the Canal</h2>
    <p>
      For centuries, explorers imagined cutting through the Central American isthmus to link two oceans. The French attempted the canal in the 1880s but failed due to disease, landslides, and mismanagement. When the U.S. took control in 1904, it became a global symbol of the Progressive Era’s drive for innovation.
