    <p>Long before the United States began construction, Europeans imagined a waterway through Central America. The French, led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, attempted the first major effort in 1880 but were defeated by disease, floods, and scandal. The dream persisted, inspiring future engineers and nations to see the canal as a way to unite hemispheres and revolutionize trade.</p>
