    <p>Yellow fever, malaria, and dysentery made early construction deadly. Under Dr. William Gorgas, sanitation became central to success. His team drained swamps, fumigated homes, and screened windows, eradicating the mosquito that carried yellow fever. By 1906, deaths had plummeted, proving that public health was as vital as engineering.</p>
