      <h2>Social & Political Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The Panama Canal was more than an engineering feat—it was a symbol of American power and expansion during the Progressive Era. The United States’ involvement in Panama’s independence from Colombia reflected both strategic ambition and imperial influence.

        The construction also exposed racial hierarchies. White workers received higher pay and better housing, while Black and Caribbean laborers faced discrimination and the most dangerous tasks. Despite this, their contributions were indispensable to the project’s success.
