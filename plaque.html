    <h2>"Bridging Oceans: The Construction of the Panama Canal (1904–1914)"</h2>

    <p>
      The Panama Canal stands as one of the greatest accomplishments of the Progressive Era.
      Authorized by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, it connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
      revolutionizing global trade and travel. Overcoming deadly tropical disease and immense engineering challenges,
      the project succeeded through determination, medical innovation, and the labor of tens of thousands of workers
      from around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The canal also marked America’s rise as a global power—an intersection of progress, technology, and empire.
      Completed in 1914, it remains a symbol of both human achievement and the contradictions of progress:
      ingenuity paired with inequality, and ambition intertwined with control.
